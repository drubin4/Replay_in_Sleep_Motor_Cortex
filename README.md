# Replay_in_Sleep_Motor_Cortex
Code supporting the manuscript "Learned motor patterns are replayed in human motor cortex during sleep" by Rubin et al.

The Matlab files included in this directory contain the code used to perform the analyses and generate the figures for Rubin et al. , "Learned motor patterns are replayed in human motor cortex during sleep". 

In addition to the included matlab functions, data extraction from raw data files requires access to data extraction code suites produced by BlackRock Microsystems (NPMK) for extraction of intracranial datasets and Epilog (or any generic .edf reader) for exctraction of scalp EEG datasets. Each of these additional code suites can be obtained via the respective manufacturers' websites.
